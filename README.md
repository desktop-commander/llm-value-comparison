## What this answers

Most LLM leaderboards rank models. This tool asks a different question: **given a model, which way of getting tokens is cheapest?** The answer depends on your hardware, your usage, and which plan you already pay for.

We compare three sources of AI tokens on a single axis — **quality-adjusted tokens per dollar**:

1. **🖥️ Local hardware** — one-time cost, unlimited usage (capped by your GPU)
2. **💳 Subscription** — flat monthly fee (ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Business, Claude Pro/Max 5×/20×, etc.), capped by quota
3. **🔌 API** — pay per token, unlimited scale

The same model via Claude Max 20× at $200/mo, via the API at $15/MTok, and via local hardware on an RTX 4090 give wildly different tokens-per-dollar depending on how much you actually use. This tool puts all three on one ranking.

## Why "quality-adjusted"?

Not all tokens are equal — a token from a smarter model is worth more than a token from a weaker one. We multiply raw token counts by a **quality score** — a z-score-normalized blend of Arena text ELO, Arena code ELO, and Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index — so a $0.50/MTok tiny model doesn't beat Claude Opus just because it's cheaper.

| Skill | Triggers when user says… | What it does |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------|
| [`ai-value-advisor`](skills/ai-value-advisor/SKILL.md) | "which AI is best value", "ChatGPT Plus vs Claude Pro", "best local LLM for my GPU", "is ChatGPT Business worth it" | Reads bundled data, detects user's hardware, asks about use case + usage + budget, recommends best plan/setup with caveats |
| [`submit-usage-measurement`](skills/submit-usage-measurement/SKILL.md) | "measure my Claude Max quota", "benchmark ChatGPT Business", "contribute data to best-value-ai" | Runs the measurement script, validates output, opens a PR to `measurements/` |

`ai-value-advisor` ships with a snapshot of the full dataset (`models.json`, `hardware.json`, `benchmarks.json`) bundled alongside `SKILL.md`. Agents read from these local files — no network call needed, works offline, no failure mode when the site is down. The snapshot is regenerated on every site deploy via `scripts/prerender-seo.js`, so a fresh install gets recent data. The snapshot date is in `skills/ai-value-advisor/data/_meta.json`; if it's more than 30 days old, the skill will tell the user and point them at the live site.

`submit-usage-measurement` doesn't need data at all — it runs the measurement scripts and opens a PR with the results.

## Features

* **🏆 Winner cards** — Best value in each category, auto-calculated, no config needed

* **⚔️ Compare** — Side-by-side model comparison with bar charts
* **📈 Timeline** — Value trends over time by provider
* **📏 Benchmarks** — Explainer on why we use Arena ELO + AA Intelligence (z-score normalized)
* **📋 Raw data** — All data in tables with source links

## Quality scoring

We use **z-score normalized** Arena ELO + AA Intelligence Index as the quality metric. These are the only two benchmarks that remain comparable across model generations (2023→2026). Task-specific benchmarks (SWE-bench, Aider, etc.) are shown in raw data but not used in the main value calculation — they can't fairly compare GPT-3.5-era models with GPT-5.4-era models.

See the [Benchmarks section](https://desktopcommander.app/best-value-ai/#benchmarks) on the live site for the full explanation.

## Data sources

All data is synced from multiple sources. See [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md) for full details.

### Manual (community PRs)

- **Local tok/s benchmarks** — run a model on your hardware, measure, submit with specs
- **Subscription token limits** — measured empirically, see below
- **New model entries** — especially Chinese open-weights and smaller models

### Subscription token measurement
Providers don't publish exact token quotas per plan. We measure them empirically:

1. Launch the CLI (Codex or Claude Code) via `tmux`, read `/status` before
2. Run a standardized coding task repeatedly (Python doubly-linked-list + 10 pytest tests) while counting tokens from the CLI's `--json` output
3. Watch the quota meter (`weekly_pct_left` on Codex, `weekly_all_pct_used` on Claude) until it crosses 1% multiple times
4. Record cumulative tokens at each crossing. Ignore the first crossing (unknown starting position inside its 1% bucket). Estimate from the inter-flip deltas.

**Scripts:** `scripts/measure-codex-quota.sh` and `scripts/measure-claude-quota.sh`

**Current reference measurements (multi-flip method, Apr 24 2026):**

Full methodology: [MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md](MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md)

#### Running the scripts

Both scripts take the **model name as the second positional argument** (the first is the working directory where the task will write scratch files):

```bash
# Claude Code — measure Sonnet or Opus on whatever Claude plan you have
bash scripts/measure-claude-quota.sh /tmp/claude-scratch sonnet
bash scripts/measure-claude-quota.sh /tmp/claude-scratch opus

# Codex CLI — measure any OpenAI model exposed to your ChatGPT plan
bash scripts/measure-codex-quota.sh /tmp/codex-scratch gpt-5.4
bash scripts/measure-codex-quota.sh /tmp/codex-scratch gpt-5.5
```

If you omit the model, the script runs against whatever default the CLI has configured (but then you can't be sure which model actually got measured — pass the flag).

#### Tuning the run (env vars)

Both scripts accept the same env vars for controlling the measurement:

Env varDefault (Claude / Codex)What it does`TARGET_FLIPS`3 / 3Stop after N × 1% meter crossings. More = more precise, uses more quota.`PARALLEL`10 / 1Concurrent task runs per batch. **Main speed-vs-precision knob.**`TARGET_METERweekly_all_pct_used` / `weekly_pct_left`Which quota meter to watch.`CACHE_BUST`0 / 0Set to `1` to prepend a unique nonce per run, killing prompt cache. Burns 5–10× more quota per measurement but reflects worst-case real-world usage where prompts vary.`MAX_BATCHES`40 / —Claude only. Safety ceiling.`NUM_RUNS`— / 30Codex only. Total run budget.

**Sizing** `PARALLEL` **by plan — the key decision.** Each batch should move the weekly meter by about 1%. Less is slow; more collapses multiple flips into one batch and destroys multi-flip resolution.

PlanClaude `PARALLEL`Codex `PARALLEL`Notes**Claude Pro** ($20/mo)2–3n/aSmall quota. We burned all 5h quota on PARALLEL=20 once. Stay low.**Claude Max 5×** ($100)5–10n/aNot yet measured; estimate from 20×**Claude Max 20×** ($200)20–30n/aBig quota, headroom for fast runs**ChatGPT Plus** ($20)n/a3–5Each run ≈ 0.25–0.5% of weekly**ChatGPT Business** ($30/seat)n/a1–3Empirically each run ≈ 0.5–0.8% of weekly; PARALLEL=1 safest**ChatGPT Pro** ($200)n/a15–25Not yet measured

**The warning sign:** if the first batch moves the meter by more than 1% and you see *multiple flips recorded with the same* `cumulative_tokens` *value*, the run is contaminated. Kill with `Ctrl-C`, lower `PARALLEL` by half, retry. (The Codex script prints a ⚠ warning when this happens; the Claude script is more permissive, watch manually.)

**Cache-bust mode (**`CACHE_BUST=1`**):** our standardized task hits 67–100% prompt cache because we run the same prompt repeatedly. That makes our measurements a "best case" — real-world agentic loops with varied prompts cache much less. Setting `CACHE_BUST=1` prepends a unique nonce per run so the cache always misses, giving you a worst-case estimate. Each measurement burns 5–10× more quota in this mode.

#### Full examples

```bash
# Claude Sonnet on Claude Pro — conservative (Pro has small quota)
TARGET_FLIPS=3 PARALLEL=3 \
  bash scripts/measure-claude-quota.sh /tmp/claude-scratch sonnet

# Claude Opus on Max 20× — aggressive (Max has plenty of room)
TARGET_FLIPS=3 PARALLEL=30 \
  bash scripts/measure-claude-quota.sh /tmp/claude-scratch opus

# GPT-5.5 on ChatGPT Plus — moderate (Plus moderate quota, 5.5 burns ~2× per token vs 5.4)
TARGET_METER=weekly_pct_left TARGET_FLIPS=3 NUM_RUNS=30 PARALLEL=3 \
  bash scripts/measure-codex-quota.sh /tmp/codex-scratch gpt-5.5

# GPT-5.4 on ChatGPT Business with cache-bust for worst-case data
CACHE_BUST=1 TARGET_METER=weekly_pct_left TARGET_FLIPS=3 NUM_RUNS=15 PARALLEL=2 \
  bash scripts/measure-codex-quota.sh /tmp/codex-scratch gpt-5.4
```
