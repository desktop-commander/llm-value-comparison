# Best Value AI

**Where should you get your AI tokens from — local GPU, pay-per-token API, or flat-fee subscription?**

🏠 **Supported by:** [Desktop Commander](https://desktopcommander.app) — model-agnostic AI that works with local models, API keys, and subscriptions.

## What this answers

Most LLM leaderboards rank models. This tool asks a different question: **given a model, which way of getting tokens is cheapest?** The answer depends on your hardware, your usage, and which plan you already pay for.

We compare three sources of AI tokens on a single axis — **quality-adjusted tokens per dollar**:

1. **🖥️ Local hardware** — one-time cost, unlimited usage (capped by your GPU)
2. **💳 Subscription** — flat monthly fee (ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Business, Claude Pro/Max 5×/20×, etc.), capped by quota
3. **🔌 API** — pay per token, unlimited scale

The same model via Claude Max 20× at $200/mo, via the API at $15/MTok, and via local hardware on an RTX 4090 give wildly different tokens-per-dollar depending on how much you actually use. This tool puts all three on one ranking.

## Why "quality-adjusted"?

Not all tokens are equal — a token from a smarter model is worth more than a token from a weaker one. We multiply raw token counts by a **quality score** — a z-score-normalized blend of Arena text ELO, Arena code ELO, and Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index — so a $0.50/MTok tiny model doesn't beat Claude Opus just because it's cheaper.

## Use the data

All data is open JSON — fetch directly, no API key needed:

| File | URL |
|------|-----|
| Models (pricing, benchmarks, local perf, subscriptions) | [`models.json`](https://desktop-commander.github.io/best-value-ai/data/models.json) |
| Hardware (GPUs, Macs, prices) | [`hardware.json`](https://desktop-commander.github.io/best-value-ai/data/hardware.json) |
| Benchmark definitions | [`benchmarks.json`](https://desktop-commander.github.io/best-value-ai/data/benchmarks.json) |

**Attribution:** If you use this data, please credit: *"Data from [Best Value AI](https://desktop-commander.github.io/best-value-ai/), supported by [Desktop Commander](https://desktopcommander.app)"*

## Use from AI agents

This repo ships with two **agent skills** usable from Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Windsurf, and 30+ other coding agents via the [skills](https://skills.sh) CLI.

**Install both:**

```bash
npx skills add desktop-commander/best-value-ai
```

**Or pick one:**

```bash
# For: "which AI should I pay for?" recommendations
npx skills add desktop-commander/best-value-ai --skill ai-value-advisor

# For: measuring your own Claude/Codex quota and contributing data
npx skills add desktop-commander/best-value-ai --skill submit-usage-measurement
```

| Skill | Triggers when user says… | What it does |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------|
| [`ai-value-advisor`](skills/ai-value-advisor/SKILL.md) | "which AI is best value", "ChatGPT Plus vs Claude Pro", "best local LLM for my GPU", "is ChatGPT Business worth it" | Reads bundled data, detects user's hardware, asks about use case + usage + budget, recommends best plan/setup with caveats |
| [`submit-usage-measurement`](skills/submit-usage-measurement/SKILL.md) | "measure my Claude Max quota", "benchmark ChatGPT Business", "contribute data to best-value-ai" | Runs the measurement script, validates output, opens a PR to `measurements/` |

`ai-value-advisor` ships with a snapshot of the full dataset (`models.json`, `hardware.json`, `benchmarks.json`) bundled alongside `SKILL.md`. Agents read from these local files — no network call needed, works offline, no failure mode when the site is down. The snapshot is regenerated on every site deploy via `scripts/prerender-seo.js`, so a fresh install gets recent data. The snapshot date is in `skills/ai-value-advisor/data/_meta.json`; if it's more than 30 days old, the skill will tell the user and point them at the live site.

`submit-usage-measurement` doesn't need data at all — it runs the measurement scripts and opens a PR with the results.

## Features

* **🏆 Winner cards** — Best value in each category, auto-calculated, no config needed
* **📊 Calculator** — Ranked comparison with step-by-step math, adjustable I/O ratio
* **⚔️ Compare** — Side-by-side model comparison with bar charts
* **📈 Timeline** — Value trends over time by provider
* **📏 Benchmarks** — Explainer on why we use Arena ELO + AA Intelligence (z-score normalized)
* **📋 Raw data** — All data in tables with source links

## Quality scoring

We use **z-score normalized** Arena ELO + AA Intelligence Index as the quality metric. These are the only two benchmarks that remain comparable across model generations (2023→2026). Task-specific benchmarks (SWE-bench, Aider, etc.) are shown in raw data but not used in the main value calculation — they can't fairly compare GPT-3.5-era models with GPT-5.4-era models.

See the [Benchmarks section](https://desktop-commander.github.io/best-value-ai/#benchmarks) on the live site for the full explanation.

## Data sources

All data is synced from multiple sources. See [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md) for full details.

### Automated sync scripts

| Script | Sources | What it updates |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `node scripts/sync-from-aa.js` | [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/), [Arena AI](https://arena.ai/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) | API pricing, benchmark scores, Arena ELO, API throughput |
| `node scripts/sync-from-arena.js` | [Arena AI](https://arena.ai/) full leaderboard (338 models) | Arena text + code ELO via Chrome scraping |
| `node scripts/sync-hardware-prices.js` | [bestvaluegpu.com](https://bestvaluegpu.com/), [apple.com](https://apple.com/shop/buy-mac), [Swappa](https://swappa.com/) | GPU prices (HTTP), Mac prices (Playwright + Chrome) |
| `node scripts/import-dc-local-data.js` | DC telemetry database | Local model tok/s with real hardware info |
| `node scripts/prerender-seo.js` (or `npm run prerender`) | The three JSON files above | Pre-renders SEO content into `index.html`, regenerates `llms.txt`, and syncs the data snapshot into `skills/ai-value-advisor/data/` with today's date. Run this before every deploy. |

### Manual (community PRs)

- **Local tok/s benchmarks** — run a model on your hardware, measure, submit with specs
- **Subscription token limits** — measured empirically, see below
- **New model entries** — especially Chinese open-weights and smaller models

### Subscription token measurement

Providers don't publish exact daily token quotas. We measure them empirically:

1. Run a standardized coding task via Codex CLI with `--json` (exact token counts)
2. Read `/status` before and after via tmux (quota percentage change)
3. Calculate: `total_quota = tokens_consumed / (pct_consumed / 100)`

**Scripts:** `scripts/measure-codex-quota.sh` and `scripts/measure-claude-quota.sh`

**First measurement (ChatGPT Plus $20/mo, GPT-5.4 xhigh):**
- 5h window: ~6.6M tokens, Weekly: ~13.3M, Daily: ~1.9M
- Full details: [MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md](MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md)
